# Questions
 1. I am  building a professional portfolio to showcase my  work from General Assembly. My portfolio will have links to examples of projects I have already completed,

 2. I am building it for myself, my fellow coders from my linkedin community, and employers who have reached out to me requesting to see my portfolio. I also what my future employers to see my unique talents and learning potential. Unlike any field I have been in or read about software engineers are more about the ability to learn and not about knowing everything. While my community from General Assembly has taught me about the growth mindset, I would like this ideology to spread like wildfire. I may not have any answers now but doesn't mean I can't seek them out.

 3. Features via User Stories.

  - Frameworks:
   - css: Bulma

      - Contact:
        - Contact form (Sendgrid)
