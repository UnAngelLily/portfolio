# Questions
 1. I am  building a professional portfolio to showcase my  work from General Assembly. My portfolio will have links to examples of projects I have already completed, a Mistake blog where I can blog about my different Learning Opportunities and provide a way for people to contact me.

 2. I am building it for myself, my fellow coders from my linkedin community, and employers who have reached out to me requesting to see my portfolio. The blog (CODER'S BLOCK) is to help me remember lessons I've learn from previous projects and to normalize the process of becoming a developer. So often we see the end result but don't realize that our mistakes are our greatest asset when creating. I want my blog to stand out as a testament of what I can accomplish when I learn a new language, but also as a reminder so I don't have to repeat lessons too many times. I also what my future employers to see my unique talents and learning potential. Unlike any field I have been in or read about software engineers are more about the ability to learn and not about knowing everything. While my community from General Assembly has taught me about the growth mindset, I would like this ideology to spread like wildfire. I may not have any answers now but doesn't mean I can't seek them out.
